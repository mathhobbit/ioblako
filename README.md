# ioblako
A platform for rapid automation (even without human intervention). 
Ioblako was built for Linux, openBSD, FreeBSD and for majority of commercial operating systems. The core functionality was produced about 24 years ago.
Though it is only a tiny glimps of a vast industry tested set of tools, I think, this snipet of code would be enough to show with examples how to build a system that can be self-managed, slef-improved (learning stuff) 
and self-sustained with minimal or no human intervention.
